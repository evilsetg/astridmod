* Astridmod - a Luanti Mod for in-game programming
This mod adds nodes and items to facilitate in-game programming and is strongly inspired by the [[https://github.com/minetest-mods/mesecons][mesecons]] lua controller.
*Be aware that you will probably crash your game with this at some point.*

This mod adds the following nodes and items:
** programming node
Allows a player to enter lua code and execute it.

** function floppy
Functions entered into the function floppy become available to all other items that execute code.

** code wand
On right click edit the code and on left click execute it.
